1st iteration
I downloaded the example code and played around with it. At first, the servo didn’t move. So I wrote a simple code that only powered the servo to test if it was a hardware issue. Turned out the servo was fine — I had just wired it wrong. After fixing that, the servo worked, but since the time interval was so short, the servo kept shaking. I increased the time interval, and now it works.

2nd iteration
In this setup, the servo always tends to go back to the same position. When the light isn’t strong enough, the LED turns on, and the servo holds its position.
I added an LED on pin D2 that turns on when the LDR reading is low.
The servo was constantly jittering because the LDR readings fluctuated slightly. I fixed this by adding a threshold system — the servo only moves when the LDR value changes by more than 10 units. This eliminated the jitter while keeping it responsive to real light changes.
